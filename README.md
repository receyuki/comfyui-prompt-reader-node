This is a subproject of the 
<a href="https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader">SD Prompt Reader.</a>
It helps you extract metadata from images in any format supported by the 
<a href="https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader">SD Prompt Reader</a> and saves the images with 
additional metadata to ensure compatibility with metadata detection on websites such as Civitai.

## Installation
>While ZIP package is available, it is strongly recommended not to use it for installation.
### Install and update via [ComfyUI Manager](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Manager) (Recommended)
Search for `SD Prompt Reader` in the ComfyUI Manager and install it.
### Install manually
Please make sure to install the submodules along with the main repository.
1. `cd` to the `custom_node` folder
2. Clone this repo
    ```shell
    git clone --recursive https://github.com/receyuki/comfyui-prompt-reader-node.git
    ```
3. Install dependencies
    ```shell
    cd comfyui-prompt-reader-node
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
#### Update
When updating, don't forget to include the submodules along with the main repository.
```shell
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

## Usage
### Prompt Reader Node
- The `Prompt Reader` Node works exactly the same as the 
[standalone SD Prompt Reader](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader). 
It uses the Image Data Reader from the 
[standalone SD Prompt Reader](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader), 
allowing it to support the same formats and receive updates along with the 
[SD Prompt Reader](https://github.com/receyuki/stable-diffusion-prompt-reader).
- Due to custom nodes and complex workflows potentially causing issues with SD Prompt Reader's ability 
to read image metadata correctly, it is recommended to embed the `Prompt Saver` Node within the workflow 
to ensure maximum compatibility.   
- For images containing multiple sets of parameters, such as those processed through `hires-fix` or `refiner`, 
you will need to modify the `parameter_index` to select the parameters you need
- For images generated by SDXL and containing multiple sets of prompts, 
the `text_g` will be combined with `text_l` into a single prompt

</div>

### Prompt Saver Node
- The `Prompt Saver` Node and The `Parameter Generator` Node are designed to be used together.  
- The `Prompt Saver` Node will write additional metadata in the A1111 format to the output images 
to be compatible with any tools that support the A1111 format, 
including SD Prompt Reader and Civitai. 
Due to custom nodes and complex workflows potentially causing issues with SD Prompt Reader's ability 
to read image metadata correctly, it is recommended to embed this node within the workflow 
to ensure maximum compatibility.   
- Since it's not possible to directly extract metadata from `KSampler`, it is necessary to 
use the `Parameter Generator` Node to generate parameters and simultaneously output them to both 
the `Prompt Saver` Node and `KSampler`.
- Please refer to the following table for placeholders supported by the `filename` and `path`.

   | Placeholder |
   |-------------|
   | %date       |
   | %time       |
   | %counter    |
   | %seed       |
   | %steps      |
   | %cfg        |
   | %extension  |
   | %model      |
   | %sampler    |
   | %scheduler  |
   | %quality    |
- `%counter` cannot be used for the `path`. This `%counter` is slightly different from the `%counter` 
in the built-in Saver node, it will count all image files in the `path`.
- When the filename already exists, an index will be added at the end of the filename, 
e.g. `file.png, file_1.png, file_2.png`.
- For the `date_format` and `time_format`, please refer to 
[strftime.org](https://strftime.org/) or [www.strfti.me](https://www.strfti.me/).

## Parameter Generator Node
- Since it's not possible to directly extract metadata from `KSampler`, it is necessary to 
use the `Parameter Generator` Node to generate parameters and simultaneously output them to both 
the `Prompt Saver` Node and `KSampler`.
- The `Parameter Generator` Node can also be used as a control panel for complex ComfyUI workflows, just like the [AP workflow](https://perilli.com/ai/comfyui/).
- The `model_version` and `aspect_ratio` are used only for calculating the optimal resolution of the selected model version 
under the chosen aspect ratio. The calculation method is based on the 
[Stability AI development documentation](https://platform.stability.ai/docs/features/api-parameters#about-dimensions) 
and the [StableSwarmUI source code](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI) (developed by Stability AI).
- `refiner_start` refers to the proportion of steps completed when the refiner starts running, 
i.e., the proportion of base steps to total steps. This is used to calculate the `start_at_step` (`REFINER_START_STEP`)
required by the refiner `KSampler` under the selected step ratio.

### Prompt Merger Node & Type Converter Node
- Since the A1111 format cannot store `text_g` and `text_l` separately, SDXL users need to use 
the `Prompt Merger` Node to combine `text_g` and `text_l` into a single prompt.
- Since `model_name`, `sampler_name`, and `scheduler` are special types 
that cannot be directly used by some other nodes,
You can use the `Type Converter` Node to convert them into `STRING` type.
